# Openlayers Multiplatform Mobile
Test application that uses Cordova to create an Openlayers map on different mobile and web platforms

Follow this <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.0.0/guide/cli/index.html">guideline</a> on Cordova to start with the project.


After, you can use the command 

<b>cordova run browser</b>

to start app on your browser

or

<b>cordova run android</b>

to emulate your app on an Android device (i connect it with my physical device)
